I'm Mark from e-replacement
0:12
parts.com in this quick fix I'm going to
0:14
show you how to sharpen the blade on
0:16
your lawn mower sharpening the blade on
0:18
your lawn mower is a basic part of any
0:20
lawnmower maintenance simply put a sharp
0:23
blade cut better a sharp blade will
0:25
require less power from the engine on
0:27
your lawn mower a dough blade will tend
0:30
to tear the grass when you cut it and a
0:32
torn blade of grass can allow disease to
0:34
enter into your lawn we'll start by
Removing the Blade
0:37
removing the blade I'm going to tip my
0:39
lawn mower back and support its handle
0:41
underneath my workbench to get access to
0:43
the blade you could also tip the lawn
0:45
mower on its side but you'd never want
0:47
to tip the lawn mower towards the side
0:49
where the carburetor is if you do all
0:51
the fuel will leak out of your lawn
0:52
mower
1:00
I'll use a rag to grab the blade this
1:02
will protect my hand as I remove the
1:04
bolt that holds the blade to the
1:19
mower with the blade removed now we can
1:21
move on to sharpening it we're going to
1:23
look at three different methods to
1:24
sharpen the blade starting with a file
1:28
for the file method I like to clamp the
1:30
blade
1:33
Vice now I can use my file to file the
1:37
edge I'm going to maintain the same
1:39
angle that is on the blade I use the
1:42
file filing
1:47
downward and notice that I only cut on
1:50
the downward stroke then I remove the
1:52
file for the next stroke doing this will
1:54
make your file stay sharp longer
2:02
I just work the file until the Blade's
2:04
sharp and I've removed the majority of
2:06
the Nicks from the edge of the
2:07
blade the next method we'll look at is
Bank Grinder
2:10
using a bank grinder to sharpen your
2:12
blades with this method you simply hold
2:14
the blade up against the wheel and draw
2:17
it across I'll show you how to do that
2:19
now I'll go ahead and turn on the bank
2:22
drer and now it's just a matter of
2:24
maintaining the angle on the blade as I
2:26
grind

Handheld Grinder
2:56
the last method we're going to talk
2:57
about is using a handheld grinder to
2:59
grinder blades this is my favorite
3:02
method and the one I use myself with my
3:03
own lawn mower for this method again
3:06
we'll clamp the blade in a
3:09
visce and then I'll use the grinder to
3:12
grind the blade again with this method
3:14
the important thing to remember is to
3:16
just simply maintain the angle on the
Balancing the Blade
3:27
blade okay the last thing we need to do
3:29
before can install the blade back into
3:31
our lawn mower is to make sure that it's
3:33
balanced the easiest way to do that is
3:35
to take a nail and clamp it in the
3:39
visce making sure that it's
3:42
horizontal and then I'll just set the
3:44
hole in the center of the blade over the
3:48
nail and this will show us if the blade
3:50
is
3:51
balanced as you can see on my blade this
3:54
side's sitting a little lower than this
3:56
side which means I need to grind just a
3:58
little more metal off this side
4:01
and last I just need to install the
4:03
blade back into the
4:23
lawnmower and that's how easy it is to
4:26
sharpen the blade on your lawn mower
